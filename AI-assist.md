# AI-assist.md

This document describes how AI tools were used during the development of this assignment.

---

## 🤖 AI Tools Used

- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**

No proprietary code or third-party paid sources were used.

---

## 📌 Purpose of AI Usage

AI tools were used strictly as a **development assistant**, similar to documentation or search usage, to:

- Understand Stripe Checkout integration flow
- Validate edge cases (double-clicks, idempotency, empty cart)
- Draft documentation (README.md)

---

## 🧠 Areas Where AI Assisted

### 1. Architecture & Design Decisions
- Choosing **Stripe Checkout** over Payment Intents
- Deciding between AJAX vs POST-based form submissions


### 2. Frontend Guidance
- Complete page is degigned by Chatgpt based on my Prompt. At last i combined and restrcutured all.
- Safe usage of JavaScript without impacting backend billing logic
- Using Bootstrap modals for cart and orders


### 5. Documentation
- Structuring and wording of README.md
- Explaining assumptions, limitations, and design choices clearly

---

## ⚠️ Responsibility Statement

- All code was written, reviewed, and understood by me.
- AI-generated suggestions were **adapted**, not copy-pasted blindly.
- I am able to explain every part of the codebase and the decisions made.
- Final responsibility for correctness, security, and functionality lies with me.

---

## ⏱️ Time Impact

Using AI tools helped:
- Reduce time on designing Frond-End Page
- Improve confidence in design decisions


However, significant manual effort was still required for:
- Implementation
- Debugging
- Testing
- Refinement

---

## 📄 Summary

AI was used as a **supporting tool**, not as a replacement for problem-solving or coding skills.  
All core logic, integrations, and decisions were implemented with full understanding and ownership.
